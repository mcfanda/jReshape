      <p>There are <b>four different types of merging</b> operations:<br/><br/>
      1) <b>Keeps All Cases (Rows)</b><br/> 
      keeps all cases (but if some input data sets did not contain that value
      of the matching variable, there might be missing values for variable
      from that data set).<br/>
      2) <b>Keeps Only Cases Contained in All Merged Data Sets</b><br/>
      Keeps only those cases where a particular value of the matching variable
      was contained in all datasets.<br/>
      3) <b>Keeps All Cases From the Currently Opened Data Set</b><br/>
      Keeps all rows/cases from the active data set (whereas cases that are only
      contained in the data sets defined under "Data Set(s) to Add" are dropped).<br/>
      4) <b>Keeps All Cases From the Data Sets To Be Added</b><br/>
      Keeps all cases from the data sets defined under "Data Set(s) to Add"
      (whereas cases that are only contained in the active data set are
      dropped).</p><hr>
      <p>If there are variables with the same name in several of the input data
      sets, it will checked whether they contain the same content.<br/>
      If they are the same, only the first of these identical variables is kept
      (and the others are removed).<br/>
      If they are different, the name of the first of these variables is kept, 
      and a suffix with their position (_2, _3, etc.) will be added to the name
      of all other variables.</p></div>
